He didn't send subs to do the job, but actually showed up himself with a crew. They're attention to detail was awesome; there was no splatter left over and they didn't leave a mess anywhere. He also helped me understand what I needed based on what I was trying to accomplish and the expected use of the space. We look forward to having them back to do our driveway soon!"

On the day that I called, Mark answered the phone himself even though it was after the normal work day. We set a day for him to come out and evaluate the job. Mark arrived on time, was friendly and polite, and gave me a reasonable quote. Mark and his crew arrived promptly on the day of the job. They pressure washed the wall, sealed all cracks in the wall, used drop cloths to cover the ground, and painted two coats of good quality Behr exterior paint. Some of my bushes had to be trimmed away from the wall in order to complete the job. Before they left, all of the trimmings were cleaned up. The job was completed efficiently and professionally. The wall looks great and I recommend them."

Mark was referred to me by my friend who showed me his walkways and driveway after Mark finished, absolutely gorgeous. So I asked him if he painted kitchen cabinets. What followed, nothing less than amazing. We ended up having Mark refinish our kitchen and both bathrooms cabinets. They also epoxy finished our counters in all three rooms, and epoxy finished the three floors AND our sunroom as well. The devil is in the details and in this case, prep. Mark and his crew miss nothing. Clean, neat, on time, and the price, very fair in comparison. If Mark accepts your job, your lucky to have him.

We were already back up in Ohio when project started but he sent many pictures of the completed project, along with our neighbor checking everything the whole time.

Then they said they were done but the lines from where the old cabinets were you could see, they didnt blend it correctly, so they fixed that. I have CRPS and was having a major flare up so after they fixed that I pd them (entirely too much) and told them they could go. Later that evening I finally made it out to look at it and I was boiling, there is paint all over my backsplash, instead of taking the plates off to outlets, they just painted the sides and tops of the plates, there are spots where the old stuff is bleeding through and he only painted half of my kitchen. They also dropped mud on my new cabinets and just left it on there. Now for the bathroom, the same thing, painted half of the bathroom. I immediately called him and asked him if he could come by today so I could talk to him, he said, yes, tomorrow afternoon I'll call you and I can come by. Needless to say, this not so much of a business owner didn't call me, I cld him twice, of course I got his voicemail both times, of course this rip off mother is worthless wouldn't recommend to anyone.
