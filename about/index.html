        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">How It All Started</h2>
        
        <p>Mark McCormick has been in the painting and coating business for over 30 years. He didn't start Advanced Coatings because he wanted to run the biggest operation in Florida—he started it because he wanted to do good work and build something he could be proud of.</p>

        <p>Like a lot of contractors, Mark started small. Just him, his tools, and a work truck. Back in those early days, it was mostly residential painting jobs—nothing fancy. But what set Mark apart was how he treated each project. He showed up on time, did thorough prep work, and didn't leave until the job was done right. Word got around, and before long, neighbors were calling him because someone down the street had recommended him.</p>

        <p>That's still how the business works today—one quality job leading to another.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">What Makes Advanced Coatings Different</h2>
        
        <p>Over three decades, Mark's learned that most homeowners don't just want their house painted—they want someone who actually cares about the end result. They want someone who won't cut corners, who'll use materials that last, and who won't disappear when the job gets tough.</p>

        <p>That's where the "Beyond Painting" approach comes in. Mark treats every surface like it's going to need to stand up to Florida's brutal sun, humidity, and afternoon thunderstorms. Because it will. He's seen what happens when contractors rush through prep work or use cheap products, and he's built his reputation on doing the opposite.</p>

        <p>Whether it's an epoxy garage floor, a freshly painted exterior, or a refinished pool deck, Mark approaches each job the same way: like it's his own house. That means proper surface prep, quality Sherwin-Williams products, and attention to the little details that most people miss.</p>

                <h3>He Answers the Phone</h3>
                <p>When you call Advanced Coatings, you're not getting a call center—you're getting Mark. If he's on a ladder, he'll call you back that day. He's been doing business this way for 30 years.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-card">
                <h3>He Shows Up</h3>
                <p>If Mark says he'll be there Tuesday at 9 AM, he'll be there. He knows your time is valuable, and he doesn't waste it. It's one of the reasons customers keep coming back.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-card">
                <h3>He Does It Right</h3>
                <p>Mark's usually on site with his crew, making sure every step—from prep to cleanup—meets his standards. He's particular about the details because he knows that's what makes the difference between a job that looks good for a year and one that lasts a decade.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p style="margin-top: 40px;">Mark's worked all over Central Florida—The Villages, Ocala, Mount Dora, Clermont, and everywhere in between. He's built relationships with homeowners who've trusted him not just once, but for multiple projects over the years. That kind of trust doesn't come from flashy advertising—it comes from consistently doing what you said you'd do.</p>
