        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">How It All Started</h2>
        
        <p>Mark McCormick has been painting and coating surfaces in Central Florida for over 30 years. He didn't start Advanced Coatings to become the biggest operation in town. He started it to do good work and build something he could be proud of.</p>

        <p>Like most contractors, Mark started small. Just him, his tools, and a work truck. Those early days meant mostly residential painting jobs. Nothing fancy. But what set Mark apart was simple: he showed up when he said he would, prepped surfaces the right way, and stuck around until the job was actually finished. His customers noticed. Their neighbors noticed too.</p>

        <p>Pretty soon, he didn't need to advertise. One good job led to the next one. Thirty years later, that's still how it works.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">What Makes Advanced Coatings Different</h2>
        
        <p>After three decades in this business, Mark knows something important: most homeowners don't just want their house painted. They want someone who gives a damn about how it turns out. They want someone who won't cut corners or disappear when things get complicated.</p>

        <p>That's the real meaning behind "Beyond Painting." Mark treats every surface like it has to survive Florida's brutal sun, suffocating humidity, and those sudden afternoon storms that roll in out of nowhere. Because it does have to survive all that. He's seen what happens when contractors rush the prep work or use cheap materials. His whole business is built on doing the exact opposite.</p>

        <p>Whether it's an epoxy garage floor, a home exterior that needs repainting, or a pool deck that's seen better days, Mark approaches every job the same way: like it's his own house. That means real surface prep, quality Sherwin-Williams products, and paying attention to the details most contractors ignore.</p>

        <h2 style="margin-bottom: 30px;">What to Expect When You Work With Mark</h2>
        
        <div class="process-grid">
            <div class="process-card">
                <h3>He Answers the Phone</h3>
                <p>When you call Advanced Coatings, you get Mark. Not a receptionist, not a call center. If he's up on a ladder, he'll call you back that same day. He's been doing it this way for 30 years.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-card">
                <h3>He Shows Up</h3>
                <p>If Mark says Tuesday at 9 AM, he means it. He knows your time matters. That's one of the reasons people keep calling him back for their next project.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="process-card">
                <h3>He Does It Right</h3>
                <p>Mark's usually on site with his crew, walking through every step from prep to cleanup. He's particular about the small stuff because that's what separates a job that looks good for a year from one that lasts ten.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p style="margin-top: 40px;">Mark has worked all over Central Florida. The Villages, Ocala, Mount Dora, Clermont, and everywhere in between. He's built relationships with homeowners who trust him for multiple projects over the years. That kind of trust doesn't come from slick advertising. It comes from doing what you said you'd do, every single time.</p>
